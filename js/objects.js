// Exercise 1. Write a function called makeCar that takes in two strings, make and model, and returns an object with those properties
// Example: makeCar("VW", "beetle") returns the object {"make": "VW", "model", "beetle"}

function makeCar(make,model) {
    var car = {};
    car.make = make;
    car.model = model;
    return car;
}

// Exercise 2. Use the following data to create an object named salesReport.
//     The object should have the following properties:
//       title, date, office, and employees.
//       the employees property should hold an array of objects.
//       each employee should be represented by an object with the following properties:
//         employee-number, first-name, last-name, sales-units
// 
// Monthly Sales Report
// Date: 03-17-2015
// Office: Codeup
// ===================================================

var salesReport = {
    "Employees": [""]
};


// Exercise 3. On the salesReport object you made, add the following methods.
// getEmployeeCount() should return the total number of employees
// getTotalNumberOfSales() should return the total number of units sold
// getAverageSalesPerEmployee() should return the average units sold per employee


// Exercise 4. Go to https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ryanorsinger/f77e5ec94dbe14e21771/raw/d4a1f916723ca69ac99fdcab48746c6682bf4530/profiles.json
// then copy the JSON and assign it to a variable named profiles.

// Exercise 5. Create an object named profileReport and add the following methods that use the "profiles" JSON data.
//  getProfileCount() should return the total number of profiles
//  getActiveCount() should return the number of active profiles
//  getInactiveCount() should return the number of inactive profiles
//  sumOfAllBalances() should return sum of the balance of all profiles
//  getAverageBalance() should return the average balance per users
//  getLowestBalance() should return the customer name with the lowest balance
//  getHighestBalance() should return the customer name with the highest balance
//  getMostFavoriteFruit() should return the most common fruit
//  getLeastFavoriteFruit() should return the least favorite fruit
//  getTotalNumberOfUnreadMessages() should return the number of unread messages for all users
//  getAverageNumberOfUnreadMessages() should return the average number of unread mesages per user.
//  getAverageAge() should return the average age of all users
//  getGenderCounts() should return gender count of users as an object: example {"m": 23, "f", 32} 
//  getAllCompanyNames() should return an array of all companies represented by the users
//  getMostCommonEyeColor() should return the most commonly occuring eye-color.
//  getBalancesForActiveAndNonActive() should return the balance of all non-active accounts vs. the balance of all active accounts?
//     this last method should return an object that looks like {"active-balances": 23000, "inactive-balances": 4000} w/ different numbers.


// Exercise 6. Practice with assignment by reference 
// create a variable named person1 with a name property. Assign it a name property.
// Now create a variable named person2 and assign person1 to it.
// Then reassign the name property on person2 with person2.name = "Bob";
// console.log the name property on person 1.
// Why do you think changing person2 altered person1?
// The term for this behavior is assignment by reference.


// Exercise 7. More practice with assignment by reference
// Add the following HTML to your index.html page in this project.
// <input type="text" id="input" name="input">
// now, create a variable named input and assign it document.getElementById("input").
// now run input.value = "Hello" from the JS console. Did you see any HTML change?
// Create a second variable named inputElement.
// var inputElement = document.getElementById("input");
// now, run inputElement.value = "I am altering an object by altering its properties" in your JS console.
// See how both the "input" and "textInput" varialbes are referencing the same underlying HTML element?
// This behavior is another example of "assignment by reference"
